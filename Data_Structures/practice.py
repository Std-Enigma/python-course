# Session 16 - Practice Problems

# Problem 1: Calculate the sum of all elements in a list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total_sum = sum(numbers)
print("Total sum:", total_sum)

# Problem 2: Create a dictionary of squares from 1 to 5
squares = {n: n**2 for n in range(1, 6)}
print("Squares dictionary:", squares)

# Problem 3: Find the intersection of two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection = set1 & set2
print("Intersection:", intersection)
